creolJava
==========
The main directory in this repository is "creol". That contains the creol package needed to create creolJava programs. The other folders contain sample creolJava programs. JavaDoc documentation for the creol pacage is located at http://soe.ucsc.edu/~charlie/creolJava.

Just a test.
